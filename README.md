## About
I am currently a 3rd year CS Ph.D. student from the School of Information Science and Technology@VISTEC, Thailand. I am working with Dr. [Supasorn Suwajanakorn](http://www.supasorn.com/) as a part of members in [Vision & Learning Lab (VLL)](https://vistec.ist/vision) and Assoc. Prof. Dr. [Sarana Nutanong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fEPAC_AAAAAJ&hl=en) as a part of members in [SCAlable Data System lab (SCADS)](https://vistec.ist/scads). I also collaborate with Asst. Prof. Dr. [Cheng Long](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My works are to conduct cutting-edge AI researches and prepare for the Ph.D. proposal examination. I was also selected to receive a special scholarship called "Srimedhi scholarship" from VISTEC and Thailand royal members for conducting research abroad. I am looking for a lab to join as a visiting Ph.D. student in 2022-2023.

## Bio
I received the B.Eng. degree in Computer engineering (first-class honor) from KMUTT, Thailand in 2019. My undergrad's final project is about anomaly detection on animal medical images, under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Dr. [Phond Phunchongharn](https://www.cpe.kmutt.ac.th/en/staff-detail/Phond). I did an internship during undergrad as a research assistant at Computer Networks and Communications Lab (CNCL)@NTU, and Chulabhorn Graduate Institute, Thailand.

## Research
My research interests are about deep representation learning in images, graphs, and sets.
