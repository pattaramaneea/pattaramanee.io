## About
I am currently a 4th year CS Ph.D. candidate from the School of Information Science and Technology,VISTEC, Thailand. I am under the supervision of Prof. [Supasorn Suwajanakorn](http://www.supasorn.com/) as a part of members in [Vision & Learning Lab (VLL)](https://vistec.ist/vision) and Prof. [Sarana Nutanong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fEPAC_AAAAAJ&hl=en) as a part of members in [SCAlable Data System lab (SCADS)](https://vistec.ist/scads) 
and a team leader of Retrieval & Representation Learning research group.
I also collaborate with Asst. Prof. Dr. [Cheng Long](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I was granted 1M THB royal scholarship called "Srimedhi scholarship" for conducting research abroad. I am looking for a lab to join as an intern or a visiting Ph.D. student in 2023.

## Bio
I received the B.Eng. degree in Computer engineering (Top 5% of a class, first-class honors) from KMUTT, Thailand in 2019. My undergrad's final project is about anomaly detection on animal medical images, under the supervision of Prof. [Phond Phunchongharn](https://www.cpe.kmutt.ac.th/en/staff-detail/Phond). I did an internship during undergrad as a research assistant at Computer Networks and Communications Lab (CNCL)@NTU, and Chulabhorn Graduate Institute, Thailand.

## Research
My research interests are about representation learning in computer vision (i.e., images and point clouds), graphs, and sets. Specifically, I have extensive experience in designing pre-training objectives for given specific downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, object detection, classification, or retrieval).

### Ongoing projects

* 2D Representation Learning on Indoor Scene Understanding Tasks

  **P Arsomngnern**, S Nutanong, S Suwajanakorn
  
  * Introducing a new way to learn a visual representation for better solving 2D Indoor Scene understanding tasks (i.e., semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation). This project introduces a novel technique to pre-train such a model that could given discriminative and useful visual and geometric prior for our desired downstream task without relying on pre-training on limited 3D indoor scenes as in prior works.

* Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning

  (P Arsomngern as a co-author)
 
  * Exploring an alternative method to self-discrimination learning the representation based on augmented heterogeneous graph structures.
